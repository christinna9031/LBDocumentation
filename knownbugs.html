                    <p>   <b>When I try to link my Twitch account, it says this site can't be reached. </b>  <br>
                        This has been fixed. Please download the newest version.          
</p>
<p>
    <b>When I click on -Help- in LB commands, the page doesn't work!</b><br>
Commands.html is saved locally in your LioranBoard folder, you can access it from there instead. The most recent IE/Chrome update causes this link to be malformed.
</p>     
<p><b>When I use the command Open URL, it doesn't work.</b><br>This has been fixed. Please download the newest version. </p>
<p><b>Every time I close OBS, it crashes.</b><br>This has nothing to do with LB. It is a known bug that happens with some plugins (like obs-websocket) installed in OBS.</p>
<p><b>I get a grey window with an error message when I try to install X extension.</b><br>That sometimes happens due to extra spaces in the file. Press ignore and the extension should install just fine. </p>
<p><b>Wild cards don't work for Point Redeem name.</b><br>This has been fixed. Please download the newest version. </p>
<p><b>Multiple accounts do not work when refreshing Transmitter</b><br>When using multiple accounts, the main account does not reconnect when Transmitter is refreshed, and will not listen to any alerts. Restart LB Receiver to reconnect to all your accounts. </p>
<p><b>Some special symbols and foreign language letters don't show up in the input fields</b><br>This is just a visual bug, the symbols are saved just fine (you can open the deck .ini file and check).</p>
<p><b>Cannot set up a macro key to “9”.  It says unknown. </b><br>This is just a visual text bug. The macro still works and presses the key.</p>
